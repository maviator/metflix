Metflix: Movie recommendations engines

This is a project that I am started to test and compare different recommendation systems methods. This project is also my reason to learn about how to deploy models as a service (MaaS).

The goal is to implement the following models:
- Popular : recommending the most popular movies for a user or a selected movie
- UBCF : User based collaborative filtering
- IBCF : Item based collaborative filtering
- ALS : Alternate least squares for matrix factorization

Additionaly, I will be looking on how to deploy the built model as a service and create a web-based service that will recommend similar movies to a selected movie or recommendation after rating some few movies.
